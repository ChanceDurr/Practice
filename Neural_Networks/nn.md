### Input Layer:
Receives  input from data set
### Hidden Layer:
Only accesesd through input layers, comes after input
### Output Layer: 
Outputs a vector of values that is in a format for the problem
### Neuron: 
The flow of the data from input to output
### Weight: 
input weights get adjusted based off off error
### Activation Function: 
The function that gives you your output
### Node Map: 
A map to show the flow of the neuron
### Perceptron: 
In machine learning, the perceptron is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers. A binary classifier is a function which can decide whether or not an input, represented by a vector of numbers, belongs to some specific class.
